        <p><u>Name:</u>Roza Singh</p> 
        <p><u>Student number:</u> S3830099</p>
        <p><u>Email (School): </u> s3830099@student.rmit.edu.au </p>
        <p><u>Email (Personal):</u>rozasingh34@gmail.com</p>
        <p><u>Background Information:</u> I was born in India but moved to Australia when I was eight months old. This move gave me the ability to speak English fluently, but unable to speak Hindi. However, since my parents speak Hindi, I can understand it very well. This makes conversations with relatives exceptionally difficult as I can understand what they are saying, but they can not understand my weak response. My education to date is my completion of year 12 this year, and from there I went straight in to RMIT. My pet guinea pig is one of the most interesting things about me. His name is Tanie, and while I find him adorable, others have compared him his appearance to Donald Trump.</p>

            <h1><u>What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any). </h1></u>
            <p>My interest in information technology is the business analysis and project management aspects of the job. My interest in IT started when I was very young. This was due to my parents. Both of them are in the IT profession, which exposed me to it at a very young age. My IT experience has been satisfactory but not overabundant. I have done IT as an elective since I was in grade 7 and throughout until the end of year 12. The units I completed in my college years were, Digital Media Graphics, Computer Games Programming and Design, Programming Skills Development, Introduction to Website Design, 3D Modelling, Animation & Texturing. </p>
            <h1><u>Why did you choose to come to RMIT?</h1></u>
            <p>I chose to come to RMIT for a multitude of reasons. It is a very good school, especially in regards to information technology. This has made it have an impressive reputation around Australia, and around the globe. RMIT has an online branch of the school which I would strongly benefit from, as someone who is working as well. This flexibility allows me to choose what time I can study and gives me more choice and freedom. The online side of the university is fantastic, with resources and assistance readily acquired for anyone that is enrolled.</p>
            <h1><u>What do you expect to learn during your studies?</h1></u>
            <p>In this unit of study, I expect to learn about IT in a broader sense. I expect that the course will be full of information regarding structure, the cloud, safety and security, and the rapid blending of technology and society.</p>
            <h1><u>My dream career</h1></u>

            <h1><u>A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.</h1></u>
            <p>This job requires an experienced business analyst, who is able to work independently. The business analyst would be required to project the future of the projects that are created, by looking at business processes and architectural framework within the business. For the role to be completed successfully, a strong communication channel would be required between the business analyst and the project manager. </p>
            <p>This position at this job is appealing to me for a factor of reasons. I would like to be in the writing and management side of information technology, instead of the coding element. This job allows me to do this. I would also like to not work on weekends, and would rather work longer nights instead. The security of the job is high, as it is a long term contract with extension options after the contract has ended. It would be a great job to add on a resume due to its complexity and its high profile nature. The salary for the job is very high.</p>
            <h1><u>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position.</h1></u>
            <p>The skills, qualifications and experience required for this job is significantly large. The job requires five years of experience as a business analyst, and a track record of the delivering of a project and its environment, under limited guidance. The role also requires the knowledge of business and technical terminology, the skill to document functional and technical specifications, and strong communication skills. Whilst these are all required to be considered, there are also desirable skills and qualifications which should be met. These include relevant qualifications and certifications, and the skill to be able to understand the Commonwealth frameworks quickly and efficiently.</p>
            <h1><u>A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have.</h1></u>
            <p>The qualifications, skills, and experience that I currently have is very minimal. For my qualifications, I have a year 12 certificate, which I was able to obtain this year. For my skills, I majored in technology in college, which shows on my certificate. For experience, I have been part of Accenture or a week for work experience. </p>
            <h1><u>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway), but try to be as specific as you can.</h1></u>
            <p>I will be completing a bachelors degree in information technology within the next three years. After this I plan on getting a post graduate degree named "Executive MBA" from RMIT. Whilst I will be completing my graduate diploma, I will use my bachelor degree to get a small job in IT which will require analysis and the written form of communication. This would create the foundation of work I would then evolve from over time. After a few years of experience, I would then be a suitable candidate for the job.</p>
            <h1><u>Personal Profile</h1></u>
            <h2><u>The results of an online Myers-Briggs test.</h2></u>
            <img src="mb.jpg" alt="image 1" width="500px" height="500px">
            <p>The results of the Myers-Briggs test were predictable. The three personality types that were deemed to be the most fitting for me were 'The Commander', 'The Supervisor' and 'The Inspector'. This means that I would be best for working as a leader who can strategise and control changes, and being responsible for inspecting and ensuring that everything is progressing at the expected rate. These results may influence my behaviour in a team to drift towards becoming the leader of the group. This would mean giving people certain tasks and ensuring that everyone is completing the set work. For my group, I should find people who can challenge me and push me out of my comfort zone and allow me to look at other perspectives. I should also attempt to find people who are not all strong leadership personality types as it would undoubtedly cause conflict otherwise.</p>
            <h2><u>The results of an online learning style test..</h2></u>
            <img src="learner.jpg" alt="image 1" width="500px" height="500px">
            <p>The results for the online learning style test determined that I was a visual learner. This means that I will be greatly benefited if I adjust how I learn, to a more visual style, as it will help me retain information to a greater capacity. I believe that my learning style will not influence my behaviour in a team at any capacity. How I personally learn things will not change how I interact in the group or get them to adjust to my needs. I would however, try and get likeminded people in my group, as it would help everyone in achieve the highest results possible. </p>
            <h2><u>The results of a Big Five Personality test.</h2></u>
            <img src="big5.jpg" alt="image 1" width="700px" height="500px">
            <p>According to the Big Five Personality test, I have the highest level of conscientiousness out of the big five personality traits. This means that I have high levels of thoughtfulness, good impulse control, and goal-directed behaviours. It also means that I am detail oriented and plan ahead. Agreeableness was the lowest score that I achieved. This means that I am lacking in trust altruism, kindness, affection, and otherÂ prosocial behaviors. This means that I am more likely to be competitive than people who are high in this area. This would influence my behaviour in a team to be competitive with the other teams, and constantly checking other peoples work. This is an unacceptable way of operating in a team and will do my best to ensure that I do not do this. I would not use this personality test to base the forming of a team on as it is expected that on a team, everyone should have a high level of conscientiousness, and everyone should be as agreeable as possible.</p>
            <h1><u>Project Idea</h1></u>
            <p>EDUSTREAM is an application that will assist in the reduction of the distractions from the internet. It will provide a space which is full of educational videos and programmes. This will help students and learners to spend less time scavenging the internet for videos and tutorials, and instead use this application. The creators will be interviewed and chosen, instead of the consumers being able to produce videos. The videos will also be closely monitored from other employers of EDUSTREAM, to ensure that consumers will not be troubled or disrupted in any regards. The product would help solve many issues for students.</p>
            <p>Education is becoming increasingly important all around the globe. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2019, two-thirds of Australians aged 15-64 years were fully engaged in work and/or study (66% or 10.8 million people). Six in ten school leavers were enrolled in further study (59% or 176,900 people). This project would be incremental for this large market as it would assist everyone to achieve their goals, no matter how niche their area of expertise is. It would solve the issue of students falling behind on work, inequity educators affecting students grades, and scrolling through the internet to find a proper video.</p>
            <p>This product would serve as a service for students across Australia, and be portrayed as an application such as Netflix. There are three sections on the app, 'Kindergarten to Year 12', 'Higher Education' and 'Niche Interests'. Each link would take the consumer to be led to another page where their catered needs can be met. For the link 'Kindergarten to Year 12', it will lead the viewers to tutorials for every subject for all the grades mentioned. For 'Higher Education', the consumers will instead find themselves looking at degrees which are available around Australia, and tutorials and guidance. 'Niche Interests' will attract people who have them and who do not, to learn about interests around the world. The consumer will be able to rate each video out of five stars, and be able to provide feedback personally to the creator. The rating will change the algorithm to rank people who are making videos on the same subject matter, and make the people with the highest ranking to be at the top, and the people with the worst, at the bottom. The personal feedback and comments are so that the consumers will not stumble upon abusive language or bad remarks. The personal feedback will be monitored and if it is found to be derogatory, abusive, or anything besides constructive criticism, or positivity, the person who wrote it may be banned.</p>
            <p>To purchase the application, an internet connection will be necessary. If that is provided, there will be an option which allows consumers to download the videos, so that it is constantly accessible. The application could be downloaded on most devices such as a mobile phone, laptop/personal computer, smart-board, iPad ect. The people who create the videos will go through an extensive interview process and background check. This is to ensure that only educators who have no problematic history are able to make videos. The public are not allowed to create videos and submit them on the platform because it would lead to inaccuracies of information being broadcasted to everyone viewing.</p>
            <p>The salary would be the same for all educators. This is because everyone will be good at what they do, and higher salary for higher viewer count would lead videos to have click bait titles and reduce the quality of the videos that are being published. Each employee will sign a contract to create a certain amount of videos per month, and be paid accordingly. The application would have a free limited version of it so that people would know what they are paying for. The cost of this product would be inexpensive, due to it being used primarily by students, but would need to pay the salary for the tutors. There will also be a donation fund below every tutor so that people are able to give money to certain tutors who have assisted them. The application would take only 5% of all donations, to ensure that EDUSTREAM remains running.</p>
            <p>An API (application programming interface) would be required. An API specifies how software components should interact, with each other and themselves. It is customisable, and assists in developing a program by providing all the necessary building blocks, which a programmer would then put together. Netflix uses a number of pieces of open-source software in its backend, including Java, MySQL, Gluster, Apache Tomcat, Hive, Chukwa, Cassandra and Hadoop. When the product starts gaining traction, it will need to use one or many of these open source tools.</p>
            <p>The skills required for my project to be operational, and too remain to be operational, would be coders who are able to write in languages such as java. Software would need to be written by people with prior experience in streaming sites as well as people who are able to create and develop an application. No special hardware would be required for this EDUSTREAM to run and operate smoothly and concisely.</p>
            <p>If the project is successful, the outcome will be tremendous. It would be an application that is easily downloadable, that impacts millions of people around Australia. The original problems will be solved by this application becoming to be in to existence, as it will minimise distractions, minimise time looking for videos, and students that fall behind at school. This product will greatly impact millions of lives. Consumers will be able to get facts and tutorials faster then ever before which will impact the work they are able to produce. It will also impact educators lives as they will reach more people than ever before. This application would be beneficial to everyone around Australia as everyone has the capacity to learn something new.</p>
